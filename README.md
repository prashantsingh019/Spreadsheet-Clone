  how to run application

  1. By ZIP file
     Step-1 : I had provided a zip file simply unzip it and open it in any IDE (for ex VS Code)
     Step-2 : open terminal and type a npm command "npm install" it will simply install all required packages for running the application.
     Step-3 : after all this type "npm run dev" in the terminal it will provide you a link in terminal click on that and you can see application.

  2. By cloning Repo from GitHub " https://github.com/prashantsingh019 "
     git clone <Spreadsheet-Clone>
     cd spreadsheet-ui
     npm install
     npm run dev
